  The IPRoute2 package contains programs for basic and advanced IPV4-based networking.
  Installed programs: bridge, ctstat (link to lnstat), genl, ifcfg, ifstat, ip, lnstat, nstat, routef, routel, rtacct, rtmon, rtpr, rtstat (link to lnstat), ss, and tc
  Installed directories: /etc/iproute2, /usr/lib/tc, and /usr/share/doc/iproute2-5.16.0
  Short Descriptions
    bridge: Configures network bridges
  ctstat: Connection status utility
  genl: Generic netlink utility frontend
  ifcfg: A shell script wrapper for the ip command [Note that it requires the arping and rdisk programs from the iputils package found at http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/.]
  ifstat: Shows the interface statistics, including the amount of transmitted and received packets by interface
  ip: The main executable. It has several different functions:
    ip link <device> allows users to look at the state of devices and to make changes
    ip addr allows users to look at addresses and their properties, add new addresses, and delete old ones
    ip neighbor allows users to look at neighbor bindings and their properties, add new neighbor entries, and delete old ones
    ip rule allows users to look at the routing policies and change them
    ip route allows users to look at the routing table and change routing table rules
    ip tunnel allows users to look at the IP tunnels and their properties, and change them
    ip maddr allows users to look at the multicast addresses and their properties, and change them
    ip mroute allows users to set, change, or delete the multicast routing
    ip monitor allows users to continuously monitor the state of devices, addresses and routes
  lnstat: Provides Linux network statistics; it is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program
  nstat: Shows network statistics
  routef: A component of ip route. This is for flushing the routing tables
  routel: A component of ip route. This is for listing the routing tables
  rtacct: Displays the contents of /proc/net/rt_acct
  rtmon: Route monitoring utility
  rtpr: Converts the output of ip -o back into a readable form
  rtstat: Route status utility
  ss: Similar to the netstat command; shows active connections
  tc: Traffic Controlling Executable; this is for Quality Of Service (QOS) and Class Of Service (COS) implementations
    tc qdisc allows users to setup the queueing discipline
    tc class allows users to setup classes based on the queuing discipline scheduling
    tc estimator allows users to estimate the network flow into a network
    tc filter allows users to setup the QOS/COS packet filtering
    tc policy allows users to setup the QOS/COS policies
